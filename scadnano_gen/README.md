# xml-to-scadnano
Generates a scadnano design from an assembly generated by [PolyominoTAS](http://self-assembly.net/software/PolyominoTAS/).
## Getting started
Place an .xml assembly in the _assemblies_ directory. Then run:
```bash
python xml_to_scadnano.py <file_name.xml>
```
Be sure to just input the file name and not the path to it. The resulting scadnano design will be saved in _sc\_designs_ as _file\_name.sc_.
